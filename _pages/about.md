I am in the final year of my Masters in Economics at Koç University, a private research university acclaimed for its number one-ranked economics program in Turkey. I am also a research assistant at the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye (TUBITAK). I graduated from Georgetown University with a double major in Economics and Computer Science in 2023.
