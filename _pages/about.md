I am in the final year of my Masters in Economics at Koç University, a private research university acclaimed for its number one-ranked economics program in Turkey. I am also a research assistant at the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye ([TUBITAK]). I graduated from Georgetown University with a double major in Economics and Computer Science in 2023. I am currently working on my Masters thesis with Professor [Murat Güray Kırdar]. We are looking at the impact of the Syrian immigration on the fertility  outcomes of Native Turkish women.
