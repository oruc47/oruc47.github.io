### [Autoregression Disturbances for Maximum Liklihood and Least Squares]
## C++
Analysis of the finite sample behavior of estimators and tests of 
regression models with AR disturbances, where Least Squares (LS) and 
Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation and inference are examined. 
Empirical behavior of the statistics in finite samples are analyzed using 
Monte Carlo simulation under standard and nonstandard conditions.

### [TUBITAK Price Dispersion]
## Python, Stata
Analysis of an extensive dataset of Turkish retail store prices to look 
at competitor price gaps and adjustment during high inflation. 

### [Marcoeconomic DSGE and RBC Simulations]
## MATLAB
Different Macroeconomic Simulations in MATLAB. Includes New Keynesian DSGE, 
deterministic and stochastic RBC, value and policy function iterations and 
optimizations.
